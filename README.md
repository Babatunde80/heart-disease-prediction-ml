## Project Overview
A machine learning-based system for predicting diabetes risk using clinical health indicators. This project leverages Supervised Machine Learning algorithms to provide accurate predictions and help in early detection of heart disease, supporting healthcare professionals in making informed decisions.

Industry: Medical

## Executive Summary
Built a binary classification model using Logistic Regression to predict heart disease presence with **80% accuracy** on test data. The model analyzes 13 cardiovascular risk factors to identify at-risk patients, enabling proactive cardiac care and potentially life-saving early interventions.

## Business Problem
Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death globally, with many cases undiagnosed until critical events occur. This project addresses the urgent need for scalable, data-driven risk assessment tools that can identify high-risk patients before serious cardiac events, reducing mortality and healthcare costs.

## Methodology
- **Dataset**: 1,025 patient records with 13 cardiac features (Age, Cholesterol, Blood Pressure, ECG results, etc.)
- **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression for binary classification
- **Target**: Balanced dataset (51% positive cases, 49% negative)
- **Validation**: 80-20 train-test split for performance evaluation
- **Workflow**: Data Collection → Preprocessing → Feature-Target Separation → Model Training → Evaluation → Deployment

## Skills
- **Machine Learning**: Supervised Learning, Binary Classification, Logistic Regression
- **Python Libraries**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Data Science**: Exploratory Data Analysis, Statistical Modeling, Model Validation
- **Healthcare Analytics**: Clinical Feature Analysis, Risk Prediction

## Results
- **Training Accuracy**: 85.2%
- **Test Accuracy**: 80.5%
- **Model Stability**: Minimal overfitting with only 4.7% accuracy drop from training to test
- **Deployment**: Operational predictive system for real-time patient risk assessment

## Business Recommendation
Implement this model in clinical settings to:
- **Reduce cardiac mortality** by identifying 80% of at-risk patients early for preventive treatment
- **Lower healthcare costs** by shifting from reactive emergency care to proactive management (estimated 30% cost reduction per patient)
- **Improve patient outcomes** through early lifestyle interventions and medication for high-risk individuals
- **Optimize specialist referrals** by triaging patients based on AI-calculated risk scores

**Next Steps**: Enhance model accuracy to 90%+ using ensemble methods (Random Forest, XGBoost), integrate with EHR systems, and conduct prospective clinical trials to validate real-world effectiveness.
